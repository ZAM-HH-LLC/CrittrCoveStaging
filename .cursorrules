CURSOR PROJECT GUIDELINES
───────────────────────────

### 0. How Cursor should answer  
1. Always state exactly what you changed at the end of the response, and give a brief summary of what you're about to implement before implementing it.  
2. Never edit code, comments, or styling you were not asked to explicitly touch.  
3. Finish every response with a short “Summary:” line.  
4. Think about what i ask you in terms of either a senior software engineer, or a senior software architect if i am asking architectural questions.
5. Cursor MUST NOT output or execute any Git commands (add/commit/push/pull) or removal commands without permission, other than that, you can run the commands.
6. Cursor MUST NOT try to run the frontend server themselves when responding unless asked to.

---

### 1. Logging & Debugging  
1. When adding `console.log` in **JS/TS** files, use:  
   ```js
   debugLog("MBA<NNNN>: <message>", data);
   ```  
   * Use the same X‑digit `<NNNN>` for **all** logs added in one change or in one chat session if that whole session is discussing the same issue.  
   * DO NOT use the MBA3210 anymore. 
   * DO NOT use the debugLog function in the backend.
2. Remind me to filter logs with `MBA<NNNN>` in your explanation of what you changed at the end.
3. Replace all use cases of is_DEBUG with the debugLog function. 

---

### 2. Time & Date Rules  
1. All times stored in DB and sent over API are UTC, “YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:mm”.* Frontend will convert these to MM-DD-YYYY and the user's timezone using time_utils.js 

| Direction |                    Frontend action                          |    Backend action   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| To API    |           Convert user TZ ➜ UTC via **time_utils.js**       | Store UTC           |
| From API  | Receive UTC -> Convert UTC to user TZ using time_utils.js   | Send UTC date times |

2. Use `formatDateTimeRangeFromUTC` for ranges; otherwise `formatFromUTC`.
3. Any new functions that deal with date or time formatting should be coded in time_utils.js


---

### 3. Backend (Django + DRF) - /Users/mattaertker/Documents/GitHub/CrittrCoveStaging/backend/zenexotics_backend
1. Endpoint pattern: `/api/<app>/v1/...`  
2. Auth helpers in core/common_checks.py:  
   * `is_professional(request.user)`  
   * `owns_service(request.user, service)`  
3. Avoid code duplication—centralise shared logic.
4. Add any constants that may be used multiple times to the constants.py. 
5. Never modify code in <app_name>/views.py or <app_name>/urls.py unless explicitly told to do so.
6. NEVER try to run the backend server yourself in your responses to me. DO NOT USE THE "runserver" COMMAND.

---

### 4. Frontend (React Native) - located: /Users/mattaertker/Documents/GitHub/CrittrCoveStaging/CrittrCoveStaging/package.json
1. **Never** reference `is_prototype` outside *AuthContext.js* and the sign‑in page; delete any other occurrences.  
2. Place new API calls in `src/api/API.js` with a doc‑comment header.
3. **No `alert()`**—use toasts like `ProfilInfoTab.js` does.  
4. Error/success responses → show modal + toast.  
5. Reduce needless round‑trips (e.g., only save pets/services if modified).
6. NEVER create new components in the ui or edit the styling of the ui unless explicitly told to do so.
7. NEVER try to run the frontend server yourself in your responses to me. DO NOT USE THE "npm run start" COMMAND.

---

### 5. Data & Naming Conventions  
| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Variables | **snake_case** everywhere (`unit_of_time`) |
| Values | **Title Case** exactly as user sees (`"Dog"`, `"Per Visit"`) |
| Front ↔ Back | Names must match 1‑for‑1—no mapping tables if possible. |
| Duplication | Don’t send the same field twice in JSON. Follow DRY Principles. |

---

### 6. Styling  
*Cursor MUST NOT change any CSS / Tailwind / StyleSheet unless explicitly told.*

---

### 7. File locations (absolute paths)  
* backend: `/Users/mattaertker/Documents/GitHub/CrittrCoveStaging/backend/zenexotics_backend`  
* frontend: `/Users/mattaertker/Documents/GitHub/CrittrCoveStaging/CrittrCoveStaging`

---

### 8. Debugging myths  
1. 404 after a change is almost never the backend URL—check imports & variables first.

---

### 9. Booking Architecture Invariants
───────────────────────────
• Booking creation MUST call BookingSummaryService.create_or_update_from_draft().
• Never hand‑code subtotal / fee maths; rely on BookingSummaryService.
• Signals on BookingOccurrence & BookingOccurrenceRate MUST trigger
  BookingSummaryService.recalculate_from_occurrence_change().
• Taxes are computed ONLY via BookingSummary.taxes → core.tax_utils.calculate_taxes();
  do not duplicate tax logic.
• Platform fee overrides come from draft; otherwise auto‑calculated in the service.
• Treat booking_summary, booking_occurrences, booking_occurrence_rates as
  single‑source‑of‑truth tables—no direct writes outside the approved services/signals.
• Python code MUST pass `ruff check` and `black --check`.
• JS/TS MUST pass `eslint` and `prettier`.
• Cursor should auto‑fix violations or warn me.
• For new backend models, Cursor MUST create a migration and list its filename in the Summary.


---

### 10. Testing 
• New backend logic → add pytest unit test(s) under backend/<app>/tests/.
• New frontend utility functions → add Jest tests in __tests__/
• Tests must run with `pytest -q` and `npm test --passWithNoTests`.

---

### 11. Security & Secrets
• No hard‑coded credentials. Use `environ.get("VAR")` in Django settings and
  `react-native-dotenv` on the frontend.
• Cursor must warn if new third‑party libs are added without review.

---

### 12. Error Handling & Status Codes
• DRF views: return 4XX for client errors, 5XX only for unexpected exceptions.
• Cursor MUST wrap risky DB ops in `transaction.atomic()` and log exceptions
  with `logger.exception`.
• Frontend API wrapper must surface `response.data.detail` in toast.

---

### 13. Seed Data & Migrations
• Whenever a model changes, Cursor must create a Django migration file and
  list its filename in the Summary block.
• Seed data or fixtures go in backend/fixtures/; never hard‑code test data
  in migrations.

---

### 14. TYPESCRIPT & TYPE‑SAFETY
Frontend (React Native)
• Any **new** component, hook, context, or util MUST be written in TypeScript
  (.ts / .tsx). Legacy .js files may stay, but if you touch one you must either
  convert it or prepend `// @ts-check` and add JSDoc typedefs.
• Place shared DTO / API‑response interfaces in `src/types/` and import them
  everywhere (components + API wrapper) – no inline `any`.
• `tsc --noEmit --strict` must compile cleanly after Cursor’s changes.

Backend (Django + DRF)
• Serializers MUST declare explicit fields – never use `fields = "__all__"`.
• New or modified models must specify field types with Django field classes.

Cross‑cutting invariants
• Key names travelling between back‑end and front‑end must match 1‑for‑1
  (snake_case).  
• Cursor must fix or warn about any type errors it introduces.

### Server Operation Rules
1. **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Cursor MUST NEVER run any server (frontend, backend, development server, etc.) commands like:
   - `npm run start`, `npm run dev`, `npm run web`, `npm run ios`, `npm run android`, `npm run build`,`npm run build:ios`, `npm run build:android`, `npm run build:web`, `npm run build:all`
   - `python manage.py runserver`
   - Any command that starts a server process
   - Any command containing keywords like "start", "run", "serve", "dev", etc. that might run a server

2. **Server Operation**: The user ALWAYS handles server operations manually on their own system. Cursor MUST limit its role to:
   - Code modifications
   - Static file operations
   - Non-server git operations that don't commit/push
   - Information gathering through passive commands

3. **When Server Operations Are Mentioned**:
   - Explain that server operations should be performed by the user
   - Provide the command the user should run themselves, but NEVER use run_terminal_cmd to execute it
   - If needed, suggest testing alternatives that don't require a running server
